<header>Observations, Pseudo-code analysis from the 2018 CollegeBoard MCQ Practice Exam
<ul>
<li>Pseudo code, while not functional, appears very easy to read, allowing anyone, even people without CS backgrounds to easily read code</li>
<li>When variables are set, instead of using the traditional equals sign like "var = 10", pseudo-code uses "var <- 10"</li>
<li>While languages like Python take inputs using input(), Psuedo code doesn't use the () to signify a function, but instead uses the term input to specify what data is an input.</li>
<li>Pseudo code doesn't make use of libraries, and is more focused on algorithms. Python allows you to import all different kinds of libraries for programming etc.</li>
</ul>
In Pseudo code, it is more focused on algorithmic design and readability, while other real coding languages are more advanced, focusing on programming and functionality<br><br>
<strong><font size = 20>Correcting Mistakes</font></strong><br>
The one glaring mistake I made on my college board MCQ was concerning logic gates. I never really understood logic gates, but after getting this wrong, and researching it, I understood how the question worked, and how I would get to my answer. The logic gate first checked if A was equal to B, and returned a value, then checked the values of C and D, which were both false. Both of the values returned false, allowing the whole logic system to return false if A was not equal to B, and C and D were the same value of False.
