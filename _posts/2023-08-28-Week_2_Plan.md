This week, I was able to understand a basic level of Linux Shell and JavaScript, as well as put a couple JS programs onto my website. I didn't get around to reading the code, and asking ChatGPT what it meant, so that will be completed week 3.

Struggles I had:
<ul>
<li>It was difficult for me to deploy my site to github.io, as I had a couple issues with my link, and I had issues in the past with my github commits, so my github wasn't 100% working</li>
<li>I wasn't sure how exactly to use Linux Shell, so I had to go to the docs to learn a bit even after reading about it on the nighthawk coders blog</li>
