<header>This week, we got started on our team project. In the week prior, we decided to make a game hub, and the first thing I immediately thought to make when it came to a browser game was a Cookie Clicker-esque game.</header><br>
Though, I didn't want to just make a boring old copy and paste of a famous game.<br>
<ul>My goals starting out were to:
<li>Create the basis of cookie clicker with all the upgrades and generators and such</li>
<li>Add a second element/better way to gain these upgrades</li>
<li>Add an endgame to the game, as there is no way to really beat cookie clicker</li>
</ul><br>
At this point, my ideas weren't really clear, so I just went ahead with trying to develop a basic cookie clicker game.<br>
We also originally wanted to write this on the backend, assuming that we would somehow get it to the frontend.<br>

<strong><font size = 20>So what did I end up finishing?</font></strong>

<br>By the end of the week, I had a basic cookie clicker game with an image of a minecraft cookie in the middle of it, and one basic upgrade.<br>
I was still trying to get the hang of things, so I didn't have a lot done on my game. I ended up beginning my game in HTML and JavaScript, using HTML<br>
to insert little buttons and images for the user to interact with and click on, and using JavaScript to create functions that would actually give the buttons a purpose.
