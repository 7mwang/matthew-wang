<header>The first part of week was honestly quite slow for me despite getting in the flow of making this game I wanted to be so great.</header><br>
I honestly thought at the time that I was working quite well, but looking back at it, I didn't make very much progress. I was also not in the habit of committing very often,<br>
so that really didn't help my case. One key thing I remember struggling with was the images. Since I was still developing in the backend for whatever reason, I didn't know about the <br>static folder. Once I finally figured that out, I got my images again working, seen in this commit. <a href = "https://github.com/7mwang/Asian-United-Backend/commit/a7488ea7494b0e00d235a3986aed2cb1a7c7ac47">fixed up my images it works now yay</a>
<ul>My goals at this point were to:
<li>Complete the first part of my game (all the generators, make a lot of upgrades)</li>
<li>Add a way to implement some kind of API</li>
</ul><br>
I honestly didn't 100% understand how API's and everything worked, so a lot of this week was me doing research.<br>

<strong><font size = 20>So what did I end up finishing?</font></strong>

<br>By the end of the first part of the week, I had actually gone way past my goal. I had done a good amount of work at home, and had added that little "spice" I wanted to introduce<br>
into my game. I had added a gacha system for the richer players to spend their hard earned coins in. I had also rebranded the game to be fully centered<br>
around a funny picture of my friend, and a meme we had created out of it named Alex Coins. Now, I had turned the whole point of the game into<br>
collecting and generating enough Alex Coins to win the game in the end. I had also outlined a plan for the end of my game, which was to<br>
have a sort of tycoon where you end up building a rocket. It sounds odd now, but I wanted the player to slowly gather materials<br>
to put something together to kind of "escape" the game. I had a whole animation planned out as well! The last thing I completed was<br>
to do with the API part of this week. I modified the jokes API, and after an embarassingly long while and a lot of time on ChatGPT,<br>
I was able to understand how it all worked, and got a few jokes appearing on the users screen to keep them "entertained".<br>
