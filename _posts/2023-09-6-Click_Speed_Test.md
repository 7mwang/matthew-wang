In the coming week(s), I want to be able to use a combination of HTML/CSS/Javascript to code a click speed test into my website for fun. 
Requirements for myself:
<ul>
<li>Display a button for the user to click</li>
<li>Dynamically update the number of clicks as the user clicks the button</li>
<li>Display time elapsed from the first click</li>
<li>Display clicks per second at the end of 10 seconds</li>
<li>Display lifetime clicks</li>
</ul>
