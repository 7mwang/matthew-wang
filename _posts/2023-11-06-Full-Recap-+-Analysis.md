<header>Overall, apart from getting terrorized by CORS, this project was great fun I gained good experience from working on it.<br> 
<ul>What did I end up learning?
<li>In the end, I learned loads about JavaScript while working on my game, and Python while working on APIs and databases.</li>
<li>In JavaScript I learned about interacting with CSS and animating, event handlers, sending API requests, cookies, and probability systems.</li>
<li>In Python I learned about using sqlite3 with python, writing API to interact with databases, storing data, analyzing and interacting with data, and posting/getting fron APIs</li>
<li>I also learned a few more minor things like CSS styling, encrypting data, and different bits and pieces with the inner workings of APIs.</li>
</ul><br>
<strong><font size = 20>What didn't I get to?</font></strong>

<br>In the end, I didn't get to create my rocket escape, and only implemented an honestly lame endgame that costs a bunch of a new currency to complete. Other than that, I am pretty<br>satisfied with how far I got with this game. I had a lot of struggle I overcame with APIs, and I'm proud of myself for overcoming those issues.<br>

<strong><font size = 20>How did I use x in y system?</font></strong>
<ul>
<li>I used cookies to store username data, and later called those cookies to interact with my API</li>
<li>I used sqlite3 to store game data to be loaded using a get request that activates on window load</li>
<li>I used default variables to make sure new players didn't get null or undefined game data</li>
<li>I used if statements to verify the existence of variables</li>
<li>I used get/post requests with my APIs to store and retrieve game data</li>
<li>And much much more knowledge was used throughout the project</li>
<br>
I can honestly say that I could have used my time much more effectively, but I still made many commits (much more towarsd the end to be completely transparent)<br>
to both the frontend and the backend.

This is the end of me documenting my CSP Tri 1 Journey :)
