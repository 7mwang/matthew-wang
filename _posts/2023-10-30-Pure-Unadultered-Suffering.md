<header>This week was honestly the most stressful thing I've ever put myself through in a long time.<br> <a href = "https://github.com/7mwang/Asian-United-Backend/commit/3f4df396a1ad1d3a6a97c08bf5f00ca72e9a3a04">fixed doubler going over 100</a>
<ul>My goals at this point were to:
<li>FIX MY CORS ERRORS (as well as finalizing data saving and a login system)</li>
</ul><br>
By now, I had completely stopped working with the game part of my game, and had fully dove into APIs and data.<br>
<strong><font size = 20>So what did I end up finishing?</font></strong><br>

<br>N@TM was creeping up, and my console was just full of red. I cannot begin to describe how elated I was when I saw my console was error free,<br> and data was being saved. This week, I finalized all of the APIs I was using for the time being, moved the game to our frontend, rewrote our entire (dysfunctional and incomplete)<br>frontend's login system in JavaScript aswell as connecting it to the API that I had wrote on the backend, breathed a sigh of relief and peace when I saw my console was error free, added my final changes on my game being a leaderboard, painstakingly went through and changed our image links to work with github pages (comming ~12 times because I could not fix it)<br>and then was absolutely devastated by the announcement that someone had crashed the servers right before N@TM. After performing an emergency update on our api links, we were ready to go for N@TM.<br>At N@TM, we got to showcase our code game hub to a bunch of parents who all loved it, as well as looking at some other projects since we had arrived<br>a bit early. N@TM was honestly a great time. On the weekend, I also finally finished up and committed my final database changes.
