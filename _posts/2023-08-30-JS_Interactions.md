I will put several instances of interactive pages coded mainly in JavaScript on my site, and try my best to understand how they are coded, and what does what in JavaScript
More specifically:
<ul>
<li>Put the Snake game into a webpage, and mess with the style</li>
<li>Put a calculator into my webpage, and analyze the code, to grasp a better understanding of dynamically updating forms</li>
