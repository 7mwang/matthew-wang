<header>The second part of this week was where things really started to pick up. I finished most of the main part of my game in this week!<br> <a href = "https://github.com/7mwang/Asian-United-Backend/commit/3f4df396a1ad1d3a6a97c08bf5f00ca72e9a3a04">fixed doubler going over 100</a>
<ul>My goals at this point were to:
<li>Complete the game</li>
<li>Start working more with API, implement data saving</li>
</ul><br>
At this point, the idea of adding more and more generators seemed kind of pointless to me, as most of them would just be copy-pastes of the same button and innerHTML changing.<br>
I had abandoned the previous idea of wanting to add a lot more generators, as well as abandoning the idea of my spaceship escape. I realized that I wouldn't have enough time<br>
to finish up my API work if I push the priority of the spaceship back, so I didn't work on it at all really.<br>
<strong><font size = 20>So what did I end up finishing?</font></strong><br>

<br>By the end of the week, I was quite stumped. I did implement basic data saving, but CORS errors were beginning to slowly creep into my console...<br>
