What I want to accomplish in week 3:
<ul>
<li>Tuesday: Experiment with JavaScript input</li>
<li>Wednesday: Experiment with JavaScript output</li>
<li>Thursday: Code a primitive input/output program in JavaScript through buttons</li>
<li>Friday: Finish primitive input/output program, and create another using text input</li>
<li>Weekend: Create a weekend summary of accomplishments/struggles, experiment more with snake/inputs/calculator</li>
</ul>
Overall Goals:
<ul>
<li>Understand how to use JavaScript input/output in tandem with HTML</li>
<li>Understand how JavaScript commands/functions work</li>
</ul>
<br>This week, I was able to create a HTML program to update a counter whenever a button was clicked, and make an alert pop up with a click speed shown to the user. I was also able to understand how HTML and JavaScript can interact. I was not able to create my program that I wanted to use text input for, though.
<br>
<br>Struggles I had:
<ul>
<li>It was very hard to me to grasp how the JavaScript and HTML connected together</li>
<li>It took me at least an hour for some reason to figure out how getElementById worked, and how to update content with it</li>
<li>It took me even longer to figure out how to make the HTML buttons call JavaScript functions, and have the JS functions change the content of the HTML buttons</li>
