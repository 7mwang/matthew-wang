<style>
body {
    background-image: url('images/gray-cubes.jpg'); 
    background-repeat: no-repeat;
    background-size: cover;
    min-height: 325vh

}
</style>
I want to:
<ul><br>
<li>Change the color of the snake</li>
<li>Change the input keys, so instead of arrow it uses WASD so the screen doesn't move when playing</li>
<li>Change start game key, so that you don't have to press the space bar and scroll the screen down</li>
<li>Give the new game and settings buttons a white background for visual appeal</li><br>
</ul>
Struggles I had after completing this:
<ul><br>
<li>It was hard for me to find out how to change the color of the snake, as it was listed under activeDot, and not anything snake related</li>
<li>It was also difficult for me to change the inputs from arrow keys to WASD, as the keys were defined using key codes, and not just the key itself</li>
