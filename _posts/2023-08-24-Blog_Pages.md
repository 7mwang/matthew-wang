<br>
When I first started editing my index.md page, I wanted to make it both functional and visually appealing. I struggled especially with trying to make it functional along with preserving the visual appeal of the site. I knew I wanted the site to have a sort of button-hub that led to various different places, but just didn't know where to start
<br><br>
<li><span style="font-size: 25px;">Triumphs</span></li>
</ul>
<br><br>
After a couple hours, I decided exactly what I wanted to do. I wanted to make a whole new page for my planned button-hub, which would eventually lead to various different sites, docs, and school resources, and I wanted to preserve my index.md page for an introduction to me, and who I am. I ended up doing just that, and accomplished my original goal of keeping it both functional and at least semi-visually appealing.
