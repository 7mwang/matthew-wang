Then, it prints out the costs using the dictionary, using item for the key, and value for the value. Then, it takes an input from the user and asks what fruit they would like to buy, and checks if that is a valid response. Then, it asks how many for the cost calculation, multiplying the amount by 150 if the input is \"blueberries\". Then, it calculates the cost using the amount the user inputted, and multiplies it by the cost of the fruit from the input that the user put.
